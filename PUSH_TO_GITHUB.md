## Troubleshooting

### Error: "fatal: remote origin already exists"
```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-quil-landing-page.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Error: "Permission denied (publickey)"
Use HTTPS instead of SSH:
```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-quil-landing-page.git
```

### Error: "fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a 'git' repository"
Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```powershell
cd C:\Windsurf Projects\ISM4421 E-quil\fenago21
```
