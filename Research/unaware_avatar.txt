D → Smart Market Questions:
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling: Sarah isn't explicitly thinking about 


employee burnout as a distinct problem. Instead, she's concerned about general HR metrics: rising employee turnover rates, particularly among remote staff, and a subtle but noticeable dip in overall team productivity. She might be wondering if her current wellness initiatives are truly effective, or if there's a deeper, unaddressed issue causing disengagement. The thought of a major talent exodus due to an unseen problem is a quiet fear.

What are they secretly afraid of in life: Sarah secretly fears being blindsided by a major HR crisis that she didn't foresee or prepare for. She prides herself on being proactive and strategic, and the idea of a widespread, unmanaged issue like burnout impacting her company's bottom line and reputation is terrifying. She also fears being perceived as out of touch or ineffective by her executive leadership, especially if employee well-being metrics continue to decline.

What are the angry about, and who are they angry at: Sarah isn't angry in the traditional sense, but she might feel a quiet frustration with the ambiguity of remote work challenges. She's frustrated by the lack of clear data or actionable insights to address the subtle shifts in employee behavior. She might feel a slight annoyance at the general perception that HR is solely responsible for 


employee happiness, without the necessary tools or resources to truly make a difference. She might also be frustrated with the constant pressure to innovate and improve HR processes without a clear understanding of the root causes of employee dissatisfaction.

Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:
1.  The constant stream of emails and meetings, leaving little time for strategic thinking.
2.  The difficulty in accurately gauging employee sentiment and well-being in a remote environment.
3.  The pressure to demonstrate the ROI of HR initiatives to a data-driven executive team.

Biggest secret desire in life: Sarah secretly desires to be a true strategic partner to the business, not just an administrative function. She wants to be seen as a key driver of business success, with a seat at the table where major decisions are made. She dreams of creating a workplace culture that is not only productive but also genuinely supportive and fulfilling for every employee.

Built-in bias to how they make decisions: Sarah is data-driven and relies heavily on established HR metrics and best practices. She is cautious about adopting new technologies or methodologies without clear evidence of their effectiveness. She has a bias towards solutions that can demonstrate a clear ROI and integrate with her existing HR systems.

Common words or language unique to them: "Employee engagement," "retention rates," "performance metrics," "talent management," "organizational culture," "HR analytics."

Top 3 complaints about existing solutions: Sarah isn't actively looking for a solution to burnout, so she doesn't have specific complaints about existing solutions in that space. However, she might have general complaints about her current HR software, such as a clunky user interface, lack of integration with other tools, or limited reporting capabilities.

E → Going Deep:
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions: A sense of unease about the future, a feeling of being overwhelmed by the complexity of remote work challenges, and a subtle fear of failure.

Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem: A sense of relief and control, a feeling of empowerment and strategic influence, and a deep sense of satisfaction from creating a healthier and more productive work environment.

Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:
1.  Data and evidence are essential for making sound business decisions.
2.  A company's success is directly tied to the well-being and productivity of its employees.
3.  HR has the potential to be a strategic driver of business growth, but it needs the right tools and resources.

Biggest Lifestyle Desire: To achieve a better work-life balance for herself and her family, and to feel a sense of purpose and accomplishment in her career.

F → Purchasing Habits:
Top 3 Decision Triggers: A significant increase in employee turnover, a direct request from the CEO to address declining productivity, or a compelling case study demonstrating the ROI of a new HR technology.

Prior Purchases For This Pain: Sarah hasn't made any prior purchases specifically for burnout prevention. However, she has likely invested in other HR technologies, such as performance management software, employee engagement surveys, or a new HRIS.

Price Tolerance For Offer: As a mid-tier B2B subscription, Sarah would likely be comfortable with a price point that is competitive with other HR software solutions. She would need to see a clear business case and ROI to justify the investment.

Time Horizon Of Solution: Sarah is looking for a solution that can deliver tangible results within a reasonable timeframe, ideally within the first 6-12 months of implementation.

G → Primary Wants:
Wants to gain: Actionable insights into employee well-being, a clear understanding of the root causes of disengagement, and a proactive approach to talent management.

Wants to be: A strategic partner to the business, a leader in creating a positive and productive work culture, and a champion for employee well-being.

Wants to do: Implement data-driven HR initiatives, reduce employee turnover, and improve overall team productivity.

Wants to save: Time and resources by automating manual HR processes, and money by reducing the costs associated with employee turnover and disengagement.

Wants to avoid: A major HR crisis, a decline in employee morale, and being perceived as an ineffective HR leader.

H → Empathy Map:
Seeing: High employee turnover rates in her HR dashboard, a lack of engagement in virtual team meetings, and a general sense of fatigue among her remote employees.

Thinking: "What am I missing? Why are my current wellness initiatives not working? How can I get a better handle on what's really going on with my remote teams?"

Hearing: Vague complaints from managers about their team's performance, industry buzz about the challenges of remote work, and pressure from the executive team to improve HR metrics.

Feeling: A sense of unease, frustration, and a growing concern that she's not doing enough to support her employees.

Saying: "We need to do a better job of supporting our remote employees," "I'm concerned about our recent turnover numbers," "I need more data to understand what's really going on."

Doing: Analyzing HR data, researching best practices for remote work, and exploring new ways to measure employee engagement.
