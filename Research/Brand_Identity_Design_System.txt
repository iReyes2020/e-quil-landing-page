      "h1": {
        "value": "48px"
      },
      "body": {
        "value": "16px"
      }
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "unit": {
      "xs": {
        "value": "4px"
      },
      "sm": {
        "value": "8px"
      },
      "md": {
        "value": "16px"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Developers will consume these tokens directly in their code, for instance, using CSS custom properties (`var(--color-brand-primary)`) or equivalent mechanisms in other frameworks. This approach ensures that any updates to the design system are automatically propagated across the entire product, maintaining visual integrity and reducing technical debt.

### 4.2. Accessibility Standards

**Key Accessibility Principles & Implementation:**

- **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
  - **Color Contrast:** All text and interactive elements will meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Our color palette has been designed with this in mind. Tools like Lighthouse or axe-core will be integrated into our development workflow to automate contrast checks.
  - **Non-Text Content:** All meaningful non-text content (e.g., images, icons, charts) will have appropriate alternative text (`alt` attributes) to convey their purpose to screen reader users. Complex data visualizations will include descriptive summaries or tabular data alternatives.
  - **Audio/Video:** Any multimedia content will include captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions as appropriate.

- **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
  - **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements will be fully navigable and operable via keyboard alone, with clear focus indicators. This includes buttons, links, form fields, and custom components. The tab order will be logical and intuitive.
  - **Sufficient Time:** Users will have sufficient time to read and use content. Time limits on interactive elements will be adjustable or avoidable where possible.
  - **No Seizures:** Content will not be designed in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions (e.g., no flashing content at rates between 2 Hz and 55 Hz).

- **Understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
  - **Readability:** Language will be clear and concise. Our typography choices (Inter) ensure high readability. Complex terms will be explained or linked to definitions.
  - **Predictable:** Navigation and interactive elements will behave in a consistent and predictable manner across the application.
  - **Input Assistance:** Form fields will have clear labels, instructions, and error messages. Input errors will be identified and described to the user, with suggestions for correction.

- **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
  - **Semantic HTML:** We will use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, `<form>`) to convey meaning and structure to assistive technologies. Custom components will leverage ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide equivalent semantic information and state.
  - **Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility:** The platform will be tested across a range of browsers and devices to ensure consistent functionality and presentation.

This flexibility directly supports David's need for a scalable solution that integrates into his team's diverse work habits.

**Core Principles:**

- **Mobile-First Approach:** Our development process will prioritize the mobile experience first. Designing for the smallest screen forces us to focus on essential content and functionality, which then scales up gracefully for larger screens. This ensures a lean and efficient codebase and a superior experience for mobile users.

- **Fluid Grids:** Layouts will be built using relative units (percentages, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) rather than fixed pixel widths. This allows content to adapt fluidly to the available screen space, ensuring optimal use of real estate and preventing horizontal scrolling.

- **Flexible Images & Media:** Images and other media assets will be responsive, scaling automatically to fit their containers without overflowing. Techniques like `max-width: 100%` for images and `<picture>` elements for art direction will be employed to deliver optimized assets for different viewports.

- **Media Queries:** CSS media queries will be used to apply specific styles based on device characteristics such as screen width, height, orientation, and resolution. This allows for tailored layouts, typography adjustments, and component visibility based on the viewing context.

- **Content Prioritization:** As screen real estate diminishes, content will be strategically prioritized. Less critical information or complex visualizations may be collapsed, hidden, or presented in a simplified format on smaller screens, ensuring that the most important insights remain immediately accessible.

- **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) will be designed with sufficient tap targets and spacing to ensure ease of use on touch-enabled devices, accommodating finger-based input.

**Implementation Techniques:**

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox:** These modern CSS layout modules will be extensively used for building robust and flexible grid systems that adapt effortlessly to different screen sizes. They provide powerful tools for alignment, distribution, and ordering of content.

- **Viewport Units:** Leveraging `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) for certain typographic elements or spacing can provide a truly fluid experience that scales proportionally with the viewport.

- **Performance Optimization:** Responsive images, lazy loading of off-screen content, and efficient asset delivery (e.g., WebP formats) will be critical to ensure fast loading times across all devices, particularly on mobile networks. This aligns with David's impatience for slow solutions.

By rigorously applying these responsive design principles, we guarantee that our AI-powered well-being platform provides a consistent, high-quality, and performant user experience across the entire spectrum of devices, empowering David Lee and his team to access critical insights and manage employee well-being from anywhere, at any time.

**General Principles:**

- **Readability & Maintainability:** Code will be written to be easily understood by other developers. This includes consistent naming conventions, clear comments where necessary, and logical structuring of files and directories. We will follow established style guides (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Google Python Style Guide) for our chosen languages and frameworks.

- **Modularity & Reusability:** Components and functions will be designed to be small, focused, and reusable. This reduces duplication, simplifies testing, and promotes a more scalable architecture. This is particularly important for a platform that will evolve with new features and integrations.

- **Performance Optimization:** Code will be written with performance in mind, minimizing unnecessary computations, optimizing data structures, and ensuring efficient network requests. Front-end assets will be optimized for fast loading and rendering.

- **Security:** All code will be developed with security best practices in mind, including input validation, proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF), and secure data handling. This is critical for a platform dealing with sensitive employee data.

- **Testability:** Code will be designed to be easily testable, facilitating unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. A high test coverage will be maintained to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

**Front-End Specific Practices (e.g., React/Vue/Angular context):**

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI will be built using a component-based approach, where each component is self-contained, reusable, and responsible for a specific piece of the UI. This aligns perfectly with the design system's UI components and patterns.

- **State Management:** A clear and consistent state management pattern (e.g., Redux, Vuex, Zustand) will be used to manage application data, ensuring predictable data flow and simplifying debugging.

- **Semantic HTML & ARIA:** As detailed in the Accessibility section, proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes will be used to ensure the application is accessible to all users.

- **CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules:** We will utilize modern CSS methodologies (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion, CSS Modules) to scope styles to components, prevent style conflicts, and improve maintainability.

- **Build Process & Tooling:** A robust build process using tools like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup will be configured for bundling, transpilation, minification, and optimization of assets. Linters (ESLint, Stylelint) and formatters (Prettier) will be integrated into the development workflow to enforce code standards automatically.

**Back-End Specific Practices (e.g., Python/Flask context):**

- **API Design:** RESTful or GraphQL API design principles will be followed, ensuring clear, consistent, and well-documented endpoints for data exchange. Versioning of APIs will be implemented to support future changes.

- **Database Interactions:** Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) will be used for database interactions to provide an abstraction layer, improve security against SQL injection, and enhance developer productivity.

- **Error Handling & Logging:** Comprehensive error handling will be implemented across all layers of the application, with detailed logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring. Logs will be centralized and easily searchable.

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust security measures for user authentication and authorization will be implemented, including token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) and role-based access control.

- **Scalability:** The backend architecture will be designed for horizontal scalability, utilizing stateless services and efficient resource management to handle increasing user loads and data volumes.

**Version Control & Collaboration:**

- **Git Workflow:** A standardized Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow) will be followed for version control and collaborative development.

- **Code Reviews:** All code changes will undergo peer review to ensure quality, identify potential issues, and share knowledge across the team.
